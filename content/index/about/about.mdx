import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I am currently studying at Queen's University, Kingston for Commerce. 

Growing up fascinated by technology and design; my interests lead to my passion in the cross-section between business, innovation, and human-centric design. 

I build creative solutions by bridging UX/UI and consulting knowledge.


If I'm not studying for my classes or learning how to code, you can catch me entering case competitions, watching Modern Family, or discovering new bubble tea stores in downtown Toronto.

Currently, I am at <a href="https://https://www.marsdd.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>MaRS Discovery District</Underlining></a> as a Youth Innovator. Based in Toronto, Ontario.
